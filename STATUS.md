# Project Status

Updated: 2026-07-12

## Overall

- Phase 0 repository foundation substantially complete
- Phase 1 complete
- Phase 2 complete
- Phase 3 complete and approved
- Phase 3.5 complete and approved
- Phase 4 in progress

## Current gate

Phase 4.6 is complete. Home Configurator now has a validated UI Engine covering the application foundation, room and device navigation, generic configurator framework, reusable controls, capability-driven device panels, iyO motion behaviour, responsive phone/tablet/desktop layouts and automated accessibility contract validation.

The next implementation gate is 4.7 — First Interactive Prototype.

## Validation history

- Phase 4.3 passed formatting, linting, strict TypeScript, package tests and all production builds.
- Phase 4.4 passed formatting, linting, strict TypeScript, package tests and all production builds.
- Phase 4.5 passed formatting, linting, strict TypeScript, package tests and all production builds.
- Phase 4.6 passed formatting, linting, strict TypeScript, package tests and all production builds across milestones 4.6.1–4.6.8. Final validation merged through PR #16.

## First interactive prototype

The first interactive prototype must validate:

1. persistent shell and WebGL stage;
2. room-to-device transition;
3. one real Home Assistant color-capable light;
4. color sphere manipulation and two-finger brightness gesture;
5. optimistic and confirmed state reconciliation;
6. reduced-motion behavior;
7. iPad performance and responsive layout;
8. VoiceOver and keyboard basics;
9. generic model fallback;
10. diagnostics for frame, gesture, transition and command state.

## Next

1. Start 4.7 — First Interactive Prototype.
2. Select the project license before public distribution.
3. Record any implementation-driven contract change through the relevant specification and an ADR.
